    "The top track or two for practically any band on Spotify is a *slow one*. The Cars have [Drive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuZA6qiJVfU), Green Day has [Boulevard of Broken Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Soa3gO7tL-c), Blink 182 has [I Miss You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1tAYmMjLdY).

    "While LangChain supports APIs, the Spotify API is an awful complex OAuth2 beast that doesn't fit the existing examples. The [Spotipy library](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/) is a lot easier to use, but as of this moment it isn't super-simple to run arbitrary code through LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "But let's make it happen! In this walkthrough, we'll look at:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How LangChain's `APIChain` (API access) and `PALChain` (Python execution) chains are built\n",
    "2. How to take parts of both to allow execution of arbitrary Python tools and summaries of the results\n",

The fix as a combination of fine-tuning the prompt – *\"you are ONLY providing DATA\"* – and adjusting my queries into a format closer to \"find this data, then display it this way.\"\n",
